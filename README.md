# Self-RAG Implementation for Legal Use Cases

This repository provides a Self-RAG implementation designed to deliver fact-based answers to user queries based on the text of the U.S. Constitution. You can explore and test this workflow in two ways:  

1. **Using Langgraph CLI**  
2. **Using the `self_rag_workflow.ipynb` notebook**  

### Overview  
The workflow leverages the principles of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combined with self-reflection to enhance the accuracy and reliability of generated responses.  

### Inspiration  
This implementation draws from the following resources:  
- [**Self-RAG: Learning to Retrieve, Generate, and Critique through Self-Reflection** (Research Paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11511)  
- [**Langchain Team's Example Implementation**](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/rag/langgraph_self_rag/)
